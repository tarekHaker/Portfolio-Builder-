Description: Create a web application that allows users to build and showcase their professional portfolios. Users can add their personal information, project details, skills, and upload project images. The portfolio builder should generate a personalized webpage for each user.

Requirements:

GitHub Repository: Each student should create a GitHub repository with branches for their contributions.
Authentication: Implement basic user authentication, allowing users to sign up, log in, and edit their portfolios.
Input Validation: Ensure that user inputs, such as personal information and project details, are validated to prevent incorrect or malicious data.
Technologies Stack: Use React for the frontend, and choose one of the following UI libraries: Material-UI, TailwindCSS, or React Bootstrap. For the backend, use Node.js along with either MySQL or MongoDB.
React Router: Utilize React Router for managing navigation within the portfolio builder.
Database (if using MySQL): Use Sequelize as an ORM to interact with the MySQL database
